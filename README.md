Hi, I'm Miri! 
I'm working on an interaction design master thesis project about digital legacies, 
specifically the legacies of creators like here on GitHUb. 
Because creating a project that might outlive you and be passed on to others is a special kind of legacy
that is still new but important to consider.

If this project sounds interesting to you and you want to learn more about it, or even participate in some design activities,
write a message at miri-fb@posteo.de !
